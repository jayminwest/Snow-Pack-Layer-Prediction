# Avalanche Risk Prediction

The orginal idea for this project was to create a model that couuld predict the layers within a snow pack in a given region. Initially, I thought that I would be able to use weather data to achive this goal. However, it became evident that the data I was hoping to use was too sparse and what I thought was a datascience problem was actually a meteorology problem. As such, I had to adjust the scope of this project to focusing more on predicting the overall avalanche risk in a given area using NLP techniques.
