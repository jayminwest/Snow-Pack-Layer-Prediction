A couple of inches of new snow in the afternoon could start to build small wind-loaded pockets higher in the terrain. Blowing snow and textured surfaces should help you easily identify where these spots might exist.","You may see a wind slab problem start to develop Sunday afternoon once a few inches of snow is available to blow around. Fortunately, these slabs should be rather small, shallow, and easy to anticipate. If your plans call for traveling near exposed ridgelines or close to some of the Pass’s summits, expect to find pillow-like slabs on the downwind side of features. Even though they should be pretty small, don’t let one of these tiny avalanches knock you over in steep terrain.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
First thing Sunday morning, you may find generally safe avalanche conditions around the Pass. Punchy wet snow, breakable crusts, icy slopes, and old piles of avalanche debris should be the norm. With southerly flow, this storm doesn’t really favor the Snoqualmie area. As a result, the modest precipitation during the day should help limit the hazard. 
Near and below the rain-snow line, you may find that the snow surfaces become a bit wet and sticky. We think at these lower elevations the snowpack will easily handle this little bit of rain. However, on very steep slopes, where you find wet mushy snow, you may be able to push a small loose avalanche. This will be most likely near rocky areas. Don’t let one of these very small slides carry you over a cliff. 
Even though we had a bit of spring weather this past week, below a thick layer of melt-forms the snowpack is still winter-like. As it continues its transition to spring, you may encounter isolated large “shed” style avalanches (glide, cornice, wet slab). On Sunday, these types of avalanches would be most likely at lower elevations. However, it's just good practice to not hang out in the runouts of large avalanche paths, especially if you see looming cornices or crevasse-like glide cracks on the slopes above. 
This is the last avalanche forecast for the 22/23 season. NWAC will continue issuing mountain weather forecasts each afternoon at 2:30 pm through April. We’d like to thank each of you for reading and using these forecasts to make informed safe decisions and for contributing to your community by submitting observations. Please continue to help support your backcountry friends by letting others know what you find in the mountains. Have a wonderful spring and summer! ~Dallas and Andy"
2023-04-14,Snoqualmie Pass,LOW,1 - LOW,1 - LOW,1 - LOW,"THE BOTTOM LINE
Cloudy weather and a cool breeze should help limit any wet snow concerns on Saturday and result in generally safe avalanche conditions. If you happen to find wet mushy snow on the surface, use a bit of caution. These conditions could result in isolated small loose wet slides.","In general, we expect the snow to be capped by a punchy crust or a solid icy surface. Without the help of the sun, this firmer snow will struggle to weaken. This should prevent most wet avalanches. However, if the snow surface doesn’t freeze or if there’s more sunshine than expected, you could find a few areas of wet unstable snow. You’re most likely to encounter one of these pockets near rocky outcrops and on more southerly aspects where the sunshine and warm temperatures can have the greatest effect. These small avalanches are often slow and easy to predict, but they can still push you over a cliff or carry you down a chute.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
Saturday will be a bit of a transition day for the mountains. An approaching storm will spread clouds and increasing winds across the zone, but there won’t be enough new precipitation to develop any real danger. As a result, we expect a generally stable snowpack with minimal avalanche concerns. However, you may encounter variable travel conditions with breakable crust, icy slopes, frozen debris, and pockets of dry snow. 
Besides the potential for loose wet slides, there are two other avalanche problems to consider. 
-If you travel near the tops of some of the higher peaks, you may find cold dry snow on shaded aspects. You could encounter isolated pockets of wind-loaded snow in these locations. Keep your eye out for firmer pillow-like drifts that might produce small slab avalanches. 
-Despite the date on the calendar, the snowpack at mid and upper elevations around the Pass has not fully transitioned to spring. In fact, below a stout upper crust (4/11) the snowpack is still very cold, dry, and layered. “Shed” style avalanche (glide, cornice, and wet slab) could still occur. While these seem very unlikely Saturday, it’s good practice to not linger in the runouts below large avalanche terrain. This is particularly true if you see looming cornices or crevasse-like glide cracks. "
2023-04-13,Snoqualmie Pass,MODERATE,2 - MODERATE,2 - MODERATE,1 - LOW,"THE BOTTOM LINE
Warmer temps and sunshine could quickly lead to wet avalanches in the recent snow. With a slick crust underneath, these avalanches could run easily and entrain additional snow. Move off of steep slopes if you are sinking deeply into wet, heavy snow, and be wary of steep, rocky terrain overhead.","Thursday will likely be a warm day with more sunshine than clouds. You can expect the recent snow to quickly become heavy and wet in the intense April sun and wet loose avalanches to run in steep terrain. These avalanches may start small but could increase in size as they entrain more snow sliding downhill. With a slick crust below the snow, they could also move faster than you may anticipate or trigger larger wet slabs. Rollerballs and pinwheels are the first signs that wet avalanches are becoming more likely. Move off steep terrain if you begin to sink into deep, wet snow or see steep rocks shedding snow in the sun. 

There may also be lingering glide avalanche potential on rock faces and steep, smooth slopes. So if you see a big frowning glide crack or hanging blocks of snow on rocky ledges, give yourself a wide berth around these unpredictable avalanches. You could still find lingering wind slabs in steep terrain at upper elevations. Look for textured surfaces or areas that look ""fat"" compared to the surrounding landscape to identify wind-loaded features. Using test slopes and hand pits as you travel can indicate the snow's slab potential and the strength of the bond with the old snow surface. Pay close attention to conditions near ridgelines, unsupported slopes, or confined terrain features where you're more likely to trigger one of these small avalanches.","AVALANCHE PROBLEM #2

The recent storm parade will leave behind overlapping avalanche problems to manage on Wednesday at Snoqualmie Pass. Don’t expect the snowpack to stay stagnant this time of year - new snow problems can quickly transition to wet problems given the right weather inputs. Make travel plans that give you plenty of options to adjust to changing conditions and avoid overhead hazards.","Large and unpredictable shedding avalanches such as Glides should be the avalanche problem that shapes your travel plans on Wednesday. These difficult-to-forecast events can fail without warning, sometimes long after the rain has stopped. On Wednesday, sun breaks and an end to our multiday storm cycle could provide the needed boost to tip the scales for some of these beasts. Don’t linger on slopes where you see crevasse-like cracks or hanging blocks of snow on rocky ledges. 
You could see other wet avalanches as a result of solar input on Wednesday. A new round of Loose slides could occur if the sun is able to destabilize the newly fallen snow.

Snowfall should eventually replace rain at Snoqualmie Pass as temperatures drop on Tuesday. As a result, you could encounter some new snow problems as you ascend in elevation. However, the threat for larger and scarier wet avalanches will remain. Don’t linger under hanging blocks of snow or slopes containing large cracks. ","It is going to take a bit of time for the snowpack to adjust to the amount of rain it just ingested. As a result, wet avalanche activity may diminish but will not be fully eliminated on Tuesday. As the storm cools and liquid precipitation tapers, the focus now shifts toward the unpredictable and dangerous Glide avalanches. These avalanches fail without warning and aren’t a problem you can easily manage. Steer clear of steep slopes where you see crevasse-like cracks or hanging blocks of snow on rocky ledges. 
Although we’re changing our focus toward Glides, other wet avalanches such as Wet Loose, Wet Slab, and Cornice collapses are all still on the table Tuesday. The travel advice for these problems is largely the same - stay clear of open slopes over 35 degrees wherever you encounter a wet and punchy snow surface. Any triggered wet avalanche has the potential to entrain significant snow and grow large. As temperatures drop and snowfall returns to the Pass, you could encounter some new snow problems. We anticipate any accumulation to have a favorable bond to the warm and wet surface. That said, be leery of features where the wind formed slightly deeper and firmer slabs.

It will take more than a little bit of cooler weather to bring an end to the wet avalanche concerns. Isolated natural large avalanches could occur as snow sheds from rocky and complex terrain. Stay off of steep soggy slopes and limit any time you spend beneath them.","While the bulk of the rain will have passed by Monday morning, wet avalanches may continue to occur. Some of these potential slides could be harder to trigger, but if they get rolling they will entrain plenty of wet heavy snow and act more like a bulldozer plowing down the hillside. This isn’t an avalanche problem to try and manage. Best to just stay out of its way and let the snowpack deal with the sudden switch from winter to spring. 
Wet slabs are notoriously hard to predict, but the ongoing rain falling on a cold, dry, layered snowpack is a pretty good recipe. You could also see natural loose wet, glide, and cornice avalanches with these conditions.

Very dangerous conditions are expected to develop on Sunday as an atmospheric river takes aim at Snoqualmie Pass. Wet avalanches large enough to bury and kill you will occur on most steep slopes. Sunday is not the day to hang out in the mountains, especially in avalanche terrain.","Wet avalanches will be prevalent throughout the mountains on Sunday, including slabs, loose, glide, and cornice collapses. You will likely see snow falling off rocks and ledges that are harder to put a name to. We’ll just call them ""spring shedding-type"" slides. The problems could vary from slope to slope or at different points during this rain event, sometimes overlapping. Any avalanche has the potential to grow large as it gouges down into older layers or entrains snow as it descends. Some could run far distances down into the trees. Sunday will not be a good day to hang out in terrain where avalanches can start, run, or stop.
Although some drier snow may fall at upper elevations to start this event, rising freezing levels mean that any new snow problems will eventually transition to wet snow problems. Don’t overthink it, Sunday is not the day to play in the mountains.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
As far as atmospheric rivers go, the one set to hit Snoqualmie Pass on Sunday could be considered modest. That said, we’ve seen what even modest rain events can do to our snowpack and now we have the added dimension of springtime to throw into the mix. 
Although the snow surface may already be wet from recent rain and sunny springtime weather, the moist snow only extends so deep. Below the wetting front, a layered cold dry snowpack exists with multiple interfaces capable of failing if water is able to percolate to their depth. And there are plenty of precariously hanging cornices or blocks of snow on rocky ledges that need to come down as we transition from winter to spring.
With a poor overnight refreeze expected, rising snow levels, and increasing precipitation rates, you could say that the hazard will escalate throughout the day. Or you could just keep it simple and realize that Sunday will be a lousy day to spend in the mountains and very dangerous avalanche conditions are expected. So you may as well stay home until this storm has wrapped up in a few days."

On Tuesday, you’re more likely to trigger an avalanche on specific terrain features such as steep unsupported slopes, convexities, or chutes, especially if they're wind-loaded. The unsettled springtime weather we have experienced the last few days should continue. Be prepared for changing conditions by having a travel plan that allows you to manage multiple types of avalanche problems.","Wind affected terrain features may be the most likely location for you to trigger an avalanche on Tuesday. Identifying wind-loaded slopes could prove to be a challenge. The signs may be subtle such as noticing a lightly textured surface or feeling the density of the snow change as you travel. In some cases, slabs could be buried beneath a few inches of low-density snow. On the flip side, more in-your-face observations such as actively blowing snow forming new slabs should be easy to spot. Regardless of how easy they are to identify, you should be leery of steep unsupported slopes, convexities, confined chutes/gullies, or the lee side of ridgelines. These are the most likely locations to trigger one of these avalanches.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
We’re in a rinse-and-repeat weather cycle. Periods of sunshine and convective snow showers should again grace Snoqualmie Pass on Tuesday. With this dynamic and somewhat unpredictable springtime weather comes plenty of caveats in the avalanche forecast. To simplify things, the steeper the slope, the more likely you are to trigger an avalanche in the recent storm snow. 
One example is that you might encounter Dry Loose slides (sluffs) that could grow large or run far distances. Of course, if the sun is able to break through and affect the surface, you may see the moisture content start to transition toward Wet Loose avalanches. In some locations, solar input could also help the upper snowpack gain cohesion, increasing the possibility of slab avalanches. 
Over the weekend, avalanches were failing easily in the storm snow and we received numerous reports of human-triggered slides. Multiple observations indicated that individuals were caught and carried and in some cases partially buried. Most avalanches are thought to have failed on a subtle layer a few inches above the 3/31 crust. With a few inches of snow falling each day, you’ll want to check all of the snow above this easily identifiable snowpack marker for potential issues. You should find the 3/31 roughly 1-1.5 feet below the surface."

","Signs point toward a settling but still grumpy upper snowpack at Snoqualmie Pass. Numerous avalanches triggered by backcountry travelers over the weekend have failed within or at the base of the recent storm snow. So take the time to investigate everything above the 3/31 crust for potential weak points before committing to a slope. You can do this by digging with your hand or shovel, using test slopes, or uptrack tests as you travel. Slab depth will increase as you ascend in elevation or in wind-loaded terrain. Be leery of steep unsupported slopes, confined chutes/gullies, or convexities where triggering one of these avalanches may be more likely. 
Loose avalanches will also be a concern on slopes over 35 degrees. While often thought of as a manageable problem by some backcountry travelers, don’t get surprised or tripped up by one in consequential terrain. They could run far distances on the underlying crust.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
Expect a few additional inches of snow on Monday to add to the almost 20 inches we’ve received at Snoqualmie Pass since Friday. All of this snow is sitting above a crust (3/31 interface) that should be an easily identifiable snowpack marker for your assessments. We do not anticipate any avalanche activity below this interface.
Throughout the weekend, we received multiple reports from backcountry travelers, avalanche professionals, and NWAC forecasters about sensitive Storm Slabs being triggered on steeper slopes.  Additionally, many reports indicated that loose avalanches failed easily due to human-triggers. The general thought is that most of these avalanches are failing a few inches above the 3/31 crust on an interface identified by NWAC forecasters on both Saturday and Sunday. Don't ignore these red-flag signs of instability. If someone triggered an avalanche in similar terrain to where you're thinking of traveling, odds are that you will too. You can catch up on the public observations and recent avalanches submitted over the weekend here.
We’re anticipating interspersed periods of sunshine and convective snow showers on Monday at the Pass. Generally speaking, less snow and more sun breaks are expected than what we experienced on Sunday. We may also see an uptick in winds. This springtime weather could manifest in multiple changes to the snowpack throughout the day. Solar input could help the upper snowpack gain cohesion and “slab up” a bit. It could also help snow shed from trees and rocks, triggering loose avalanches or even slabs on the slopes below. If the sun is out for an extended period of time, you may start to see Wet Loose avalanche activity develop. With cold dry snow in place, you may even see some shallow Wind Slabs forming on leeward features."
2023-04-01,Snoqualmie Pass,CONSIDERABLE,3 - CONSIDERABLE,3 - CONSIDERABLE,2 - MODERATE,"THE BOTTOM LINE
Recent human-triggered avalanches and additional snowfall should be enough to maintain dangerous avalanche conditions on Sunday. Slides will be more likely in terrain over 35 degrees and could run far distances on a firm crust. Keep an eye on how the dynamic springtime weather is affecting the snowpack, you may have to adjust your mindset as conditions change.","You should continue to be leery of open slopes over 35 degrees on Sunday. Multiple rounds of precipitation during this stormy period have resulted in a layered upper snowpack sitting on a crust. Use test slopes or dig down to the crust with your hand or shovel to investigate these potential failure points before committing to terrain. You should also look for heavy snow over weaker snow (upside-down snowpack), cracking of the surface, or recent avalanches as indicators that the snowpack is unhappy. Slabs should be larger as you ascend in elevation or in wind-loaded terrain. Even if the storm snow is not showing much cohesion or failing in blocks during your tests, it could still run far and fast on the underlying crust on slopes over 35 degrees.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
The peak of this stormy period may be over, but precipitation is expected to continue into Sunday at Snoqualmie Pass. With roughly 15 inches already on the ground at upper elevations, expected accumulations should have us approaching 2 feet of storm snow by Sunday evening. All the recent snowfall is overlaying a crust (3/31 interface) and has an inconsistent bond across the landscape, mostly based on elevation and the stoutness of the crust. 
On Saturday, numerous small avalanches were human-triggered on steeper slopes throughout the zone. Many of them failed at the base of the storm snow, but some failed within. Alpental Pro Patrol reported similar results during their morning mitigation efforts along with some small natural activity. Most of these reported avalanches ran on the 3/31 crust, sometimes traveling far distances. NWAC forecasters found multiple density breaks and plenty of weak graupel within the storm snow. Loose avalanches running on the 3/31 were also observed in steep terrain.
Don’t expect the bond to become much more favorable by the time Sunday rolls around. The added precipitation just means that slabs will be thicker and with more layers for you to investigate. You could encounter periods of heavy convective showers interspersed with more sun breaks than we experienced on Saturday. Even in short spurts, this solar input could start to change the snow surface resulting in it gaining some cohesion and “slabbing up”. You might even see a few rollerballs and Wet Loose avalanches. It’s springtime, so conditions can change rapidly. Be sure to reassess the snowpack consistently throughout the day to see how the dynamic weather is affecting it. "
2023-03-31,Snoqualmie Pass,CONSIDERABLE,3 - CONSIDERABLE,3 - CONSIDERABLE,2 - MODERATE,"THE BOTTOM LINE
A significant winter storm will create dangerous avalanche conditions at the Pass by Saturday morning. Be suspicious of any open slope over 35 degrees, especially at mid and upper elevations. Some avalanches could trigger easily and run quickly on a firm crust below.","Stormy weather with high precipitation rates, strong winds, fluctuating temperatures, and significant snowfall all point towards unstable storm slabs. This is a day to dial it back and simply avoid steep open slopes. You can look for and test these storm slabs by using hand pits and small slopes to see how the new snow reacts and if it's bonded to the old surface When you see it crack, fail suddenly, or slide in blocks, you’ve found the problem. At mid and upper elevations, the new snow may not stick well to an underlying firm crust. In these places, we think avalanches could fail easily and run fast. 
While we expect avalanches on any open slope, they could be larger and harder to manage in wind-loaded terrain. Firm thick slabs may exist along the lee side of ridges and near the base of cliffs. Unless it’s scoured to a crust, be particularly careful in wind-affected areas where these bigger avalanches could occur.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
While not a huge event, this is a significant winter storm and a big change in the weather from the past several days. With the bulk of the precipitation and strongest winds Friday night, we expect the danger to already be in place first thing Saturday morning. You may find that the hazard spikes again during periods of intense precipitation and/or blowing snow. With convective snow showers in the forecast, this could occur nearly anywhere in the zone at any point during the day. One way to manage this uncertainty is to choose routes that allow you to easily return to the trailhead without needing to travel through complex or high-consequence areas.
We’re primarily concerned with avalanches failing at or above the new/old interface (3/31). In many places, this layer is marked by a new crust (and possibly tree debris). However, prior to this storm, a variety of surfaces were observed: scoured slopes, icy crust, wet punchy snow, and pockets of dry powder. That means the new snow may react differently in various areas. Make sure to keep making observations as you travel and don’t rely on just a few data points. 
The skies should remain cloudy Saturday, but it’s April, and we can’t rule out a few sun breaks. If you start to notice the sun, odds are, so is the snowpack. You may see natural loose wet avalanches, especially near sunny rocky terrain. Some of these smaller slides could trigger slab avalanches on the slopes below."

A winter storm will bring a few inches of snow to the Pass Friday and slowly increase the avalanche danger. You may encounter a few unstable pockets of wind drifted snow especially later in the day. Blowing snow and sharp thin cornices can help you anticipate potentially loaded slopes you may want to avoid.","Strengthening winds should easily turn the few inches of new snow into a fresh batch of shallow slabs on the lee sides of ridges and near the base of cliffs. Since we’re expecting the bulk of the precipitation in the afternoon, it may take a bit for this problem to develop. Fortunately, the stormy weather should provide you with plenty of clues to help you figure out where this issue is actively forming. While these slabs should remain rather small, they could trigger easily over recent crust. So, don’t let one catch you off guard if you’re traveling above a cliff or other terrain trap that could magnify the consequences of even a small avalanche.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
First thing in the morning, you may find generally safe avalanche conditions (Low danger) around the Pass. Colder and cloudier weather should help the snowpack freeze and become strong. As more snow accumulates, expect the hazard to rise. When exactly the danger will increase is tough to say, but if you find a few inches of new snow and see blowing snow, it’s time to start thinking about wind slabs.
Given the recent weather, we’re most concerned about the new snow and its bond to the older surface. How the snow sticks to the new interface (3/30) is hard to predict. On Thursday, an avalanche professional in the Apental valley found warm moist snow. If the new snow falls before it freezes, it may bond very well. If a firm crust forms first, the new snow may slide easily. You can use hand pits and uptrack tests to see if the snow fails suddenly and/or in slab-like blocks. 
Prior to this storm, a variety of surfaces existed around the Pass. While warm moist snow was the most prevalent, firm wind-pressed snow, textured surfaces, scoured slopes, breakable crust, loads of tree debris, and frozen avalanche debris were found. On Friday, some of these obstacles may only be buried by an inch or two of new snow.
The storm will continue Friday night. As it intensifies expect the avalanche danger across the zone to rise rapidly. "
2023-03-29,Snoqualmie Pass,MODERATE,2 - MODERATE,1 - LOW,1 - LOW,"THE BOTTOM LINE
You can trigger an avalanche in lingering pockets of wind drifted snow on Thursday. Consider steering around wind loaded features if you notice active drifting or see signs of unstable snow such as shooting cracks.","Strong, sustained east winds have been ripping across the Cascades. This wind pattern is likely creating variable surfaces, but also forming slabs in some funky spots, such as west aspects or even cross loading terrain features at higher elevations. Thursday will bring a switch back to westerly winds, which may start blowing snow back onto more normal east facing slopes. 
So as you travel, don’t let your guard down as you switch aspects. Keep an eye out for these shallow wind drifted slabs all over the compass. You use visual clues to help you identify slopes of concern. Look for blowing snow, textured surfaces, or fresh rounded pillows at the snow surface to help you identify where the problem exists. As always, take a step back and reduce your exposure to steep wind loaded slopes if you notice signs such as shooting cracks or hear snow that sounds hollow like a drum.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
Thursday should bring more of the same, just with a changing wind direction and possibly some filtering sunshine to start the day. Although, clouds are forecast to thicken as the day progresses, along with increasing ridgeline winds ahead of our next system. 
Strong, sustained east winds have likely done some damage at upper elevations. On Wednesday, winds finally started easing as temperatures warmed up above freezing at the top of Alpental. This combination has likely created variable travel on most aspects and elevations below 5500’. 
Last week's snowfall overlays a melt-freeze crust on most aspects except high-elevation northerly slopes (3/22 interface). Multiple shallow (3-10"") soft slab avalanches were human-triggered over the weekend, failing within or at the base of the recent storm snow. Most of these slides appeared to be on steep convex slopes or near rocky terrain, such as rocky chutes or the base of cliffs. Avalanche professionals and NWAC forecasters identified pockets of weak snow, with a few whumpfing collapses experienced on west aspects at mid to upper elevations. 
We had some concerns about weak snow buried during this storm. If it survived, the distribution is spotty at best, but it could explain some of the collapses or a few of the triggered slabs. We are continuing to gather more information about this potential weak layer in the snowpack. So be sure to check the bond on the 3/22 interface and the snow above it as you travel on Monday. We expect any avalanche activity to occur at or above this interface."

Winds will taper off overnight, but you could still trigger avalanches in lingering unstable pockets of stiff wind-drifted snow. Look for deep, textured drifts to identify potential wind-affected terrain. Steer around steep slopes where you find these hollow-sounding drifts or observe cracks shooting away from you. ","The winds likely did some damage on Tuesday, with 18hrs of steady wind speeds over 20mph. Finding locations where this wind event did not impact the recent snow may be challenging. Expect widespread textured surfaces and stiff wind-board. The poor weather and travel conditions left us with minimal observations on the distribution and sensitivity of the wind slab problem. However, you will likely find them throughout the terrain on convex rolls, below ridges, at the base of cliffs, and cross-loaded gullies. While Wednesday will be a much milder day with calm winds, you should approach any steep wind-affected slopes with suspicion. Steep, confined, rocky terrain will be the most likely location to trigger one of these avalanches. Wind slabs likely formed over various surfaces, including slick crusts and weaker snow, so they could take some time to become unreactive. If you identify deep, hollow-sounding drifts or observe any obvious signs of instability, such as cracks shooting away from you, move to lower-angle terrain or sheltered forested areas","FORECAST DISCUSSION
With cloud cover in the forecast, it won't be the next sunny day you have been waiting for, but calm wind and increasing temperatures should once again put wet avalanches on your mind. Widespread crusts and wind-affected snow will likely limit the extent of this problem, but you may still see some small wet avalanches tomorrow. Pay attention to the consistency of the snow below you and move onto lower-angle terrain if wet, heavy snow is easily sliding downhill.
Last week's snowfall overlays a melt-freeze crust on most aspects except high-elevation northerly slopes (3/22 interface).

Easterly winds will be on a steady ramp up into the strong range with extreme gusts overnight. You will find stiff slabs of wind-drifted snow where you can trigger avalanches in atypical locations, such as further down the slope and on unusual aspects. Actively blowing snow, textured drifts, shooting cracks, and stiff hollow sounding snow are all signs of wind-loaded terrain where you should avoid steep slopes.","On Monday, the east winds ramped up, drifting the recent snow over ridges and across slopes into wind slabs. You could trigger these wind slabs on convex rolls, below ridges, the base of cliffs, and cross-loaded gullies. Expect that with the easterly wind direction and speeds up to 40mph, you are likely to find wind slabs in unusual locations. They may form below typical starting zones and on aspects generally scoured from the dominant westerly winds. Also, look for wind slabs developing in sheltered terrain at lower elevations, like open glades in the forest. With northern aspects holding plenty of dry snow available for transport, these new slabs could be quite large. These fresh wind slabs will form over various surfaces, including slick crusts and weaker snow, so they could be quite sensitive to triggering. Look for actively drifting snow, textured surfaces, and ""fat"" looking drifts to identify steep slopes to avoid. Warning signs such as shooting cracks are bullseye evidence that the snow is unstable. ","FORECAST DISCUSSION
Even though it's the end of March, it's still looking pretty wintery out there. The end of last week brought 8-18 inches of new snow, and while a couple of sunny days had us thinking about wet avalanches and formed crusts on southern aspects, northern slopes still hold cold, dry snow. This easterly wind event and the cloudy forecast will bring another round of winter, so you should put wet avalanche problems and spring diurnal mindsets away for the next couple of days and refocus on cold, dry snow problems.

Monday will be a bit of a transition day as temperatures and sunshine peak before we head into a multi-day wind event. As the weather changes, so should your avalanche problem focus. Most slides are expected to be small, but don’t let them catch you off guard near terrain traps or other consequential slopes.","There’s an east wind event coming our way. With cold dry snow already in place, increasing winds throughout the day should grow strong enough to easily transport it into shallow Wind Slabs on lee slopes. Due to the atypical wind direction, these slabs may form on aspects where you’re not used to seeing them. East wind events also often result in more mid-slope loading. Look for actively blowing snow as your easiest indication of aspects where slabs may be building. They’ll be more likely on convex rollovers and near rocky features such as the base of cliffs or confined chutes. If you suspect a slope is wind-loaded, simply avoid it by choosing another path.The slow uptick in sunshine and temperatures will continue into Monday, maintaining the possibility of Wet Loose avalanches. It will be a race to see if there is enough sunshine to destabilize the surface before the easterly winds kick in and limit this avalanche problem. Further away from the Pass proper or in areas where the easterlies have less influence, you could see more widespread wet avalanche activity.

Recent human-triggered avalanches are an indication that the snowpack hasn’t fully settled post-storm.

A multi-day storm should culminate in dangerous avalanche conditions by Saturday morning at Snoqualmie Pass. Look for cracking of the snow surface or a poor bond within or at the base of the storm snow as an indication to avoid slopes over 35 degrees. As the day unfolds, you may have to switch your mindset to focus on wind-loaded features or potentially sun-exposed slopes.","Snowfall is forecasted to continue throughout Friday night and into Saturday morning at Snoqualmie Pass. With accumulations possibly being enhanced by a convergence zone, storm totals are expected to reach depths where you should be thinking about slab avalanches on all steep slopes. Of course, in wind-loaded areas slabs will be thicker and potentially more reactive. This is especially true on specific features such as the lee side of ridgelines or in confined gullies. You can use small test slopes or quick hand pits as you travel to see how the storm snow has bonded to underlying surfaces or if there are interstorm layers of concern. You may see it failing easily in blocks or notice cracking of the surface indicating a potential problem. If you notice these signs or get concerning results with your quick tests, avoid all slopes over 35 degrees.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
Even though the calendar has switched to spring, we’re in the midst of a more winter-like storm at Snoqualmie Pass. As of Friday evening, we have received around 5 inches of snow at lower elevations which increases to over a foot up higher. If the convergence zone alluded to above hits the forecasted water numbers, we could squeeze out another 5 to 10 inches by daybreak on Saturday.
You’ll likely encounter the most dangerous avalanche conditions first thing in the morning as this storm is wrapping up and the snowpack adjusts to the new load. As the day wears on, you may find that hazard transitions towards more specific terrain features or is more likely on wind-loaded slopes. On Friday, skiers on Mount Snoqualmie reported triggering a shallow slab in a confined chute. On open slopes at upper elevations, they also reported that the storm snow cracked and failed on the underlying sun crust. Alpental Pro Patrol observed both loose and slab avalanches running at the base of the storm snow and on an interstorm layer. 
Prior to the storm, mostly warm and sunny weather impacted the zone for the majority of the week. A surface crust formed on most aspects and elevations. The caveat is high-elevation northerly terrain where dry soft snow survived and possibly faceted (weakened) during this spell. Both of these surfaces could aid in avalanches failing on Saturday, so be sure to check the bond (3/22 interface) throughout your travels. All avalanche activity is expected to occur at or above this interface on Saturday.
As the storm winds down and becomes more showery, don’t be surprised to see a sun break or two. This could result in rollerballs or even a few Wet Loose avalanches. We have been concerned about larger Glide avalanches this past week due to the generally warm weather. It’s worth continuing to minimize your time spent under slopes that contain large Glide cracks on Saturday. It is spring, after all."
2023-03-23,Snoqualmie Pass,CONSIDERABLE,3 - CONSIDERABLE,2 - MODERATE,1 - LOW,"THE BOTTOM LINE
Expect the avalanche danger to increase as you ascend Friday. More snow and strong winds at mid and upper elevations will form new slabs that may trigger easily. Blowing snow and sharp cornices can help you identify wind-loaded areas you want to avoid.","Fresh wind slabs will form along exposed ridges, near the base of cliffs, and in the tops of chutes as this storm continues to impact the Snoqualmie area. Expect slabs to grow in size and distribution as you gain elevation and as the day continues. So, if you start to see signs of wind-drifted snow, assume it will only get worse as you head higher and as the day progresses. Look for clues like blowing snow, drifts, textured surfaces, and new cornices to help you anticipate wind-loaded terrain. 
Prior to this storm snow surfaces varied by aspect. Firm crusts were found on E-S-W slopes, while faceted weak snow was seen on the more shaded side of the dial. This means some of these new wind slabs fail easily and run quickly. As they grow larger in the afternoon, these attributes could make them quite dangerous. ","FORECAST DISCUSSION
A return to winter has brought snowfall back to the Pass. As of Thursday afternoon, storm totals vary significantly with elevations. At ~3000ft only a trace of new snow has accumulated. Near the top of Alpental (5470ft), closer to 6-7 inches has fallen. The storm will continue overnight and into Friday with lowering snow levels. 
As the storm turns more showery and convective in nature mid-day, you could experience a few brief moments of sunshine. If this happens, don’t be surprised when you see rollerballs and small loose wet slides release from steep sunny slopes. By the afternoon a more intense band of showers (convergence zone) could take aim at the Pass. This would create locally stormy conditions with heavy snowfall rates that may quickly increase the danger. 
Even though temperatures are cooling and snow is returning, avalanches like glide slabs won’t stop on a dime. The recent warm and sunny weather sent water deep into the snowpack and it will take a bit for it to drain or freeze. Continue to steer clear of areas below crevasse-like cracks. 
Since we’re starting from scratch below treeline, it should take a bit for enough new snow to accumulate to present a hazard. The snow should bond well to the warm and wet surface. By Friday afternoon, you could start to see a few isolated wind slabs in exposed areas of the below treeline band. 
Prior to the storm, warm, often sunny, weather radically affected the snowpack. A crust formed on E-S-W aspects high into the terrain, and on more shaded slopes at lower elevations. In higher northerly areas, dry soft snow persisted through our little taste of spring. However, if other zones are any indication, it could have begun to facet and grow weaker. Below this old surface, we don’t have any significant layers of concern. As a result, we expect avalanche activity to generally stay near or above the 3/22 interface."

While these small thin slabs won’t pose much hazard at first, they could grow a bit larger by the end of the day. Frequently, we tell you to look for pillow-like slabs and go around. However, poor visibility in the afternoon could make it hard to spot these wind-affected areas. Blowing snow will be your best way to anticipate loaded slopes.

Wet punchy snow, new rollerballs, small teardrop shaped debris piles are all great clues that loose wet slides are becoming more likely. While you may see a few natural avalanches, most of them should stay relatively small. Just don’t let them catch you by surprise and push you into a creek or over a cliff.This problem is quite a bit more tricky and encompasses glides, cornice failures, and snow shedding from rocky faces. Recent glide avalanches and new glide cracks opening are clear signs that the snowpack has been set in motion by multiple days of warm weather.

The best way to manage this concern is to choose routes that limit any time you need to spend underneath slopes with crevasse-like glide cracks, looming cornices, or rocky faces basking in the sun.

A battle between warm springtime temperatures vs. increasing cloud cover and winds will dictate how the snowpack reacts on Sunday. You’re most likely to encounter avalanches on steep slopes where the surface is wet and sticky. Stay aware of large overhead hazards such as cornices or slopes with crevasse-like cracks where more devastating slides could occur in the warm weather.","Our warm spell should continue Saturday night into Sunday despite some incoming clouds. This will keep Wet Loose avalanches as the most likely problem you’ll encounter during your travels. It could be a bit tricky with warmer morning air temperatures than Saturday forecasted, but a return of cool easterly winds. These competing weather factors have us thinking that avalanche activity will be more muted than what we experienced on Saturday. Take note if the snow surface is wet and sticky or if you see new rollerballs and pinwheels wherever you’re traveling. Wet Loose avalanches could soon follow, starting at a point and fanning out as they descend. To manage this problem, you should head to shadier slopes, keeping aware of overhead hazards such as cornices or hanging blocks of snow that could release without warning.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
Reports rolled in throughout the day of wet avalanche activity on Saturday at Snoqualmie Pass. Most slopes that saw direct sunshine were affected, either producing rollerballs or avalanches up to size D2. Shaded slopes appeared to hold onto mostly dry snow, but trees were shedding and dripping even on the northerly half of the dial. NWAC weather stations at lower elevations soared into the 50s, while upper elevation stations were well into the 40s.
As alluded to above, a poor overnight freeze is expected Saturday night, so we could pick up right where we left off on Sunday morning with wet and sticky surfaces. In contrast to Saturday, we aren’t expecting full sunshine plus we should see a return of breezy easterly winds. This has us dropping the hazard level a notch, but conditions remain largely the same. In general, the snowpack does not like rapid change. Coming out of a recent cold and snowy pattern right into this warm period is considered rapid on a snowpack scale and we could see some unique avalanches as a result. The threat of isolated very large avalanches where blocks of snow such as cornices or glides fail due to the springtime temperatures is still on our radar.
Although the winds will likely be strong enough to drift snow into Wind Slabs on Sunday, there likely isn’t much snow available for transport. On more northerly aspects where the sun’s influence hasn’t been as strong, you could still find well-settled powder with pockets of weak snow. These same aspects also hold some of the more pronounced cornices. If you’re going to encounter a newly formed or lingering hard Wind Slab, it's in those locations. Late in the day, you could even see a dusting of snow up high or a few raindrops down low, but we aren’t anticipating enough to impact the avalanche hazard significantly."

Dangerous avalanche conditions may develop throughout the day as sunshine works to destabilize our wintertime snowpack. Warmups after a cold and snowy period often result in unusual and difficult-to-predict slides. Make travel plans with lots of options to avoid open sunny slopes and overhead hazards.","Temperatures should continue to climb Friday night into Saturday. Although some clouds may bookend the day, full sunshine is expected during the midday hours. You should anticipate Wet avalanche activity to increase throughout the day. The sunshine will first need to break down a crust from Friday before the surface starts to get wet and sticky. During this time period, you may see snow begin to shed from trees and rocks. Next, you will likely notice rollerballs and pinwheels on steep sun-exposed slopes. These are all precursors to Wet Loose avalanches. These slides will often start at a point and fan out as they descend, possibly growing large or triggering slabs in the process. When this scenario starts to unfold, your best bet will be to head to shadier slopes, keeping aware of overhead hazards.
The strong March sun could result in other avalanche problems, some of which are more difficult to manage. See the discussion for details.It has been not just cold and snowy recently, but also quite windy. This has resulted in Wind Slabs and large Cornices forming at mid to upper elevations. Although trending toward stubborn, most slabs have been identified as Hard Slabs, which are harder to predict and manage. They may not fail easily, but if they do, it will likely be without warning and could be large. (The same goes for Cornice failures which you can read more about in the discussion.) To identify wind-loaded areas, keep an eye out for features that look “fat” compared to the surrounding terrain. They’ll be most likely near ridgelines, on convex slopes, or the sides of confined gullies and can be found on multiple aspects.

Springlike weather could result in some springtime avalanches on Friday. You’re most likely to encounter them on steep sunny slopes or in upper-elevation wind-loaded terrain. While these problems are typically manageable, you should consider shaping your travel plans with the threat of larger and more unpredictable shedding avalanches in mind.","As one local avalanche professional succinctly put it, the deep winter snowpack is starting to mix with early spring radiation. As winds die down and temperatures climb, expect Wet avalanche activity to increase on Friday. The first signs that the surface is destabilizing will be if it begins to get wet and sticky or if snow starts to shed from trees and rocks. Rollerballs and pinwheels on steep sun-exposed slopes are other indications that Wet Loose avalanches may soon follow.

You'll likely encounter shallow wind slabs on a variety of aspects as east winds redistribute recent snow.  The combination of sun and slightly warmer temperatures raise the risk of cornice fall or a wet loose avalanche that could trigger a deeper avalanche in isolated areas.  Pay attention to overhead hazard and consider avoiding complex terrain at upper elevations. ","Winds will shift to the E-SE on Wednesday night potentially forming new wind slabs on westerly aspects.  You'll want to use caution on any aspect you find recently drifted snow and can trigger a shallow wind slab, most likely below ridgelines, near convex rollovers, and in the tops of chutes.  These wind slabs may trigger easily but should remain fairly small and easy to avoid. 
The more unlikely but consequential version of this problem will be isolated deeper wind slabs that may have formed a few days ago.  Deeper slabs are more likely to be found in higher elevation and cliffy terrain.  Following another round of snow and wind on Tuesday night/Wednesday,  2 natural slab avalanches released off of Chair Peak in this sort of terrain.  The best way to handle this problem is to stay off and out from under rocky complex slopes, especially where you see larger cornices. Snow shedding from above or other avalanches could release these slides naturally. New snow from Wednesday will be primed to come down on steep sunny slopes. An easterly breeze and some uncertainty around the sunshine forecast may make this problem vary across the zone.  If you start to see pinwheeling, rollerballs or natural wet loose avalanches, it's time to change aspects or move to lower angle terrain.  While you don't want to go for a ride in a wet loose avalanche, also make sure to look up and take stock of the overhead hazard.  Don’t linger on or under steep sunny slopes.  With a crust just under the surface, some of these slides could travel quickly downhill.","AVALANCHE PROBLEM #2

Warming temperatures, rain, snow, and winds will create dangerous avalanche conditions. You could easily trigger large avalanches in the new snow, particularly where the wind drifts snow deeper near ridgelines. Make conservative travel plans and stick to low-angle terrain while the storm runs its course. Depending on your elevation, you could see wet or dry snow avalanches. ","If you climb above the rain/snow line, conservative terrain will be key to avoiding storm slabs on Monday. As the warming storm deposits heavier snow over the recent light dry powder we enjoyed recently, avalanches will likely become easy to trigger on slopes above 35°. Avoid common trigger spots such as steeper, unsupported convexities even on lower angle slopes. There are observations of some older, weak interfaces where avalanches may fail within last week's snow. It will be a great day to stick to low-angle terrain and look for signs of instability, such as recent avalanches or shooting cracks. Using simple hand pits and test slopes, you can quickly assess how the new snow is reacting. If the new snow slides easily, you could trigger an avalanche on a steep slope. 

As you would expect, moderate to strong winds will accompany the storm. However, with some east flow through the passes, you could see wind loading on different aspects as you climb in elevation. Wind slabs will form overnight and continue to build during the day on Monday. Look for actively blowing snow and drifts behind rocks and trees to identify the wind direction and avoid steep wind-loaded slopes.It's been a while since our last Cascade rain event, and while this storm isn't exceptionally warm, we will likely see rain near and above pass level.

As the temperature starts to creep up ahead of a bigger storm on Sunday night, be leery of overhead cornices or other blocks of snow.","You may need to manage Wind Slabs of varying ages on Sunday. To complicate matters, they’ll likely be on an assortment of aspects due to the wind reversing direction multiple times recently. New slabs could build throughout the day as increasing winds drift recently fallen snow onto leeward slopes or other notorious wind-loaded features such as convexities or confined gullies. Look for actively blowing snow, smooth pillow-like mounds, or textured surfaces to help identify the wind-loaded features you should steer around. Additionally, you could encounter lingering slabs from Thursday night’s wind event hidden a few inches below the surface. You’ll need to feel for subtle changes in the stiffness of the snow to identify these ones. They may feel hollow and be more difficult to trigger, but if they fail they’ll likely be larger and could break in more surprising ways. ","FORECAST DISCUSSION
Backcountry travelers were greeted with 4-6 inches of new snow on Saturday morning and found that it had been drifted around by light to moderate winds. A few human-triggered avalanches were reported in the new snow by skiers in the Alpental Valley where the bond to the underlying surface is reportedly poor. Most of these occurred in wind-loaded terrain on convex rollovers or near ridgelines. Alpental Pro Patrol reported similar activity during their morning mitigation work with a few slabs up to 1 foot deep. Sunday should be a similar kind of day, except there will likely be less new snow and temperatures should start to slowly creep up ahead of an incoming storm system. With a cold and clear night forecast for Saturday evening, weak surfaces may develop. 
As temperatures start to climb, be leery of overhead cornices that have grown large during the recent windy weather. They could fail and trigger avalanches on the slopes below. On slopes that see direct sunshine, rollerballing and small Wet Loose avalanches are always a threat if the strong March sun is out for a prolonged period of time.
The past week has delivered multiple small bursts of precipitation at the Pass, yielding 1.5-2 feet of snowfall. Combined with numerous wind events coming from every direction, the upper snowpack now contains subtle storm interfaces, thin sun crusts, and is a bit upside-down in places. Weak grains such as graupel and fragments of surface hoar have regularly been observed by avalanche professionals and recreationalists alike. Some of these grains were at play when larger avalanches occurred within the zone last weekend. While we have maintained that the upper snowpack has been generally right-side-up throughout this period due to the lack of a significant slab, the incoming system on Sunday evening has the potential to turn conditions on their head or finally tip the scales for many slopes."

Near ridgelines, you still may be able to use visual clues such as newly formed cornices to give you an indication of where some of these slabs may be lurking. Unfortunately, the wind direction has flip-flopped in the last 24 hours meaning you now could find slabs on a variety of aspects. So key into terrain features where they’re more likely such as near ridgelines, on convex rollovers, or rocky terrain such as confined gullies and the base of cliffs.","FORECAST DISCUSSION

Newly fallen snow was poorly bonded to a variety of underlying surfaces and was sliding easily due to human triggers. Plenty of recent wind effect, including sensitive Wind Slabs, were observed in wind-prone areas, with the most sensitive pockets found near ridgelines and on convex rollovers. Many of these slabs formed on Thursday night and were hidden under roughly 2-4 inches of new snow.
We should squeeze out a few more inches before Saturday dawns. As a result, don’t be surprised to encounter loose avalanches running on steeper slopes. Most of these should be dry unless the sun is out for a prolonged period of time. It’s that time of the year when anytime the sun comes out and there is new snowfall, you should expect to see Wet Loose activity on steep sun-exposed slopes.
Prior to Thursday’s wind event, the upper snowpack was thought to be generally right-side-up as convective snow showers and periods of sun breaks impacted the zone throughout much of the past week. During this time period, the Pass has received roughly 1-1.5 feet of new snow. You may be able to find some storm instabilities in the upper snowpack such as layers of graupel or fragments of surface hoar, but reported avalanche activity has been limited for a number of days. Earlier this week, some deeper avalanches occurred (D2-2.5) on what is suspected to be the 2/25 interface. It’s been a number of days now and the likelihood is dropping, but if you’re going to encounter an isolated bigger slide it will likely be on this interface, possibly due to a step-down or another large trigger such as a cornice failure."

New snow and a switch in wind direction could combine to create Wind Slabs on a variety of aspects on Friday. Keep an eye out for fresh drifts or actively blowing snow to help you identify wind-loaded areas where you’re more likely to trigger an avalanche. Don’t get caught off guard by a small slide near rocks or gullies where taking a ride could be more consequential.","Wind speeds should peak in the overnight hours on Thursday night before trending downward and switching direction during the day on Friday. This means you could encounter new Wind Slabs on a variety of aspects with potentially different reactivity based on their age. Look for pillow-like drifts or areas that look “fat” compared to the surrounding terrain near ridgelines or on convex rollovers to help identify wind-loaded features you should avoid. The wind also likes to sift snow into deeper piles in confined gullies or near the base of cliffs. In some locations, you could encounter firm snow that feels hollow or notice freshly built cornices to further help key you into potentially unstable areas to steer around.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
On Thursday, avalanche professionals observed moderate to strong winds drifting snow into deeper drifts on leeward slopes and the base of cliffs. The wind direction was generally from the east, with snow being transported onto different aspects than the norm. This should continue through the evening hours and into Friday morning before wind speeds start to taper and precipitation rates increase. The result could be sensitive slabs formed due to strong winds overnight or snow and moderate winds combining to build hazard throughout the day (or potentially both).
Prior to this wind event, the upper snowpack was thought to be generally right-side-up as convective snow showers and periods of sun breaks impacted the zone throughout much of the past week. However, weak surfaces were observed in recent days and larger (D2-2.5) avalanches were reported earlier this week. Some of these avalanches broke as much as 3 feet deep and were suspected to have failed on the 2/25 interface. Most of them were in wind-loaded terrain, with one slide a result of a smaller Wind Slab stepping down to this older layer. Snowpack tests on the 2/25 by NWAC forecasters this week have not been overly impressive, but we shouldn’t ignore these red flag signs heading into a loading event, even if they are a few days old. We suspect most avalanches on Friday will be confined to the newly fallen snow, but if you’re going to see a deeper slide, it will likely be on this interface. "

You should encounter the windiest conditions of the week on Thursday. A fresh crop of Wind Slabs could develop in areas where you're not used to seeing them due to the atypical wind direction. Observing actively blowing snow is an easy way you can identify wind-loaded features where you have a higher probability of triggering an avalanche.","Wind speeds should increase throughout the day and may reach the strong category in the afternoon. With plenty of low-density snow currently available for transport, don’t be surprised to find some new slabs near ridgelines or the base of cliffs. Due to the atypical wind direction, these slabs may be on some unusual aspects. Look for actively blowing snow to help identify wind-loaded features you want to avoid. Textured surfaces, fresh cornices, and sharp drifts can also help you zero in on the location of possible Wind Slabs. ","FORECAST DISCUSSION
Most of the past week has been very similar, with patchy blue skies in the morning giving way to increasing clouds and snow showers in the afternoon. Each day winds have been just strong enough to drift a bit of snow around. On Thursday, the pattern begins to change and we are anticipating the biggest wind event of the week. 
On slopes that see direct sunshine, the amount of snow available for transport may be limited due to sun crusts formed during bouts of sunny weather this week. On more shaded aspects, the upper snowpack is still very soft and dry, meaning there is plenty of snow available for the wind to affect. 
Observations indicate that the upper snowpack is generally right-side-up heading into this storm cycle. That said, weak surfaces have been reported in recent days, and more concerningly, larger (D2-2.5) avalanches were reported earlier this week. On Monday, an avalanche professional spotted a deeper (~3ft/1m) natural slide in the Chair Peak Lake Basin (E, 5600ft). It may have failed on the 2/25 interface. Additional deep avalanches were spotted by avalanche professionals in wind-loaded terrain on Mt. Snoqualmie, with crowns estimated to be as much as 3 feet deep in places. Last Friday, we received word of a similarly deep avalanche occurring when an intentionally triggered small Wind Slab stepped down to a deeper (2.5ft/80cm) layer (N, 4300ft), also suspected to be the 2/25. Snowpack tests on this layer by NWAC forecasters have not been overly impressive, but we shouldn’t ignore these red flag signs heading into a larger loading event. If you’re going to see a deeper avalanche in the coming days, it will likely be on this interface."

Windy conditions Wednesday could build a fresh set of shallow slabs on the lee side of exposed ridges and rocky features. Be leery of smooth pillow like drifts where you see blowing snow and underneath sharp cornices.","Moderate SE winds and plenty of soft dry snow could combine to build a few new slabs on some unusual aspects. Fortunately, they should be fairly easy to spot and avoid. Actively blowing snow will be your best clue to identify features you want to avoid. Textured surfaces, fresh cornices, and sharp drifts can also indicate nearby wind-loaded pockets. 
Most of these slabs should be rather shallow and soft. This will make them a bit easier to manage. However, some of them could grow large enough (D1.5) to take you for an unwanted ride or flush you down a chute.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
We’ve been stuck in a rinse-and-repeat weather pattern most of the week. Some patches of blue sky in the morning should lead to increasing clouds and snow showers in the afternoon. Even with the possibility of a few inches of snow, it shouldn’t have much bearing on the avalanche danger. 
We think cloudier skies in the afternoon and a thin crust on southerly aspects will limit any loose wet avalanche concerns. However, if you experience prolonged warm sunny weather, snow may start to shed from rocks and trees. This could result in some piles of new rollerballs and maybe a few small loose wet avalanches. Indeed, observations from this week at the Pass, show a few isolated wet slides from brief periods of sunshine. 
On more shaded aspects, the upper snowpack is still very soft, dry, and right-side-up. Recent avalanche activity has been mostly limited to a few small natural and triggered wind slabs and loose dry avalanches. Two larger (D2-2.5) avalanches buck that norm. On Monday, an avalanche professional spotted a deeper (~3ft/1m) natural slide in the Chair Peak Lake Basin (E, 5600ft). This slide may have failed on the 2/25 interface. A similarly deep avalanche occurred last Friday when an intentionally triggered small wind slab stepped down to a deeper (2.5ft/80cm) layer (N, 4300ft). While similar avalanches seem unlikely given the current weather pattern, we can’t rule out an isolated large avalanche in sheltered shaded terrain. It may take a  larger trigger like falling cornices, other avalanches, or snowmobiles to impact these deeper snow layers. Take this into consideration before venturing into bigger more consequential terrain."

You may trigger shallow pockets of wind-affected snow near exposed ridges or in rocky complex terrain. Look for pillow-like drifts that you want to avoid before committing to higher consequence slopes.","The most likely place to trigger a slab avalanche Tuesday is in wind-affect terrain. Most of these wind-loaded pockets should be generally soft and easy to spot. Look for pillow-like slabs below cornices, along the base of cliffs, or in rocky areas. Given the recent wind direction (E-S), some of these avalanches may occur on some unusual aspects. Even though most of these slabs should be fairly shallow and easy to manage, some of them could be large enough (D1.5) to take you for a nasty ride. Think about the consequences of terrain below you before venturing onto any wind-affected feature. 
A few larger (D2) hard wind slabs may still linger at mid and upper elevations from Saturday’s (3/4) strong SE wind event. Be leery of firm hollow sounding snow, especially in convex or unsupported terrain. Hard slabs are difficult to assess and often break above you with little warning.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
While passing snow showers could bring a few inches of snow to the Pass by Tuesday afternoon, they shouldn’t affect the avalanche danger. Instead, they’ll only add to the storm totals since 2/25. Over the past 9 days, more than 4 ft of snow has fallen with cold temperatures. Not surprisingly, travelers routinely report deep conditions with a generally right-side-up snowpack. 
Most avalanche activity this past week has been limited to a few small (D1) natural and human-triggered wind slabs and loose dry avalanches. However, two deeper slides have been reported and definitely have our attention. On Monday an avalanche professional found a large (D2.5) deep (~3ft/1m) avalanche in the Chair Peak Lake Basin (E, 5600ft) We don’t know exactly when this slide occurred. The depth is rather similar to an avalanche from Friday (3/3) where an intentionally triggered wind slab stepped down to an older snow layer. In both cases, we suspect the 2/25 crust. Weak snow (facets and surface hoar) has occasionally been observed at this older interface. While these slides still appear isolated, take them into account before stepping into bigger terrain. One of these deeper slides seems most likely in shaded, sheltered areas with a larger trigger (cornice, avalanche, or snowmobile). 
While temperatures are cold, it's starting to feel a bit more like springtime. So, if the sun comes out for a longer period, expect the snow to shed from trees and rocks. This could trigger small loose avalanches on the slopes below. A thin crust formed by the Sun on 3/5 and increasing afternoon clouds should help limit any loose wet issues. However, if you see new rollerballs or teardrop shaped debris, expect avalanches on similar terrain."

Take a good look at the slope in front of you before committing to larger or more consequential terrain. E-S winds formed slabs in some unusual locations on Saturday. If you see any signs of drifts, wind lips, or pillow-like slabs then seek out an alternate, less wind-affected route.","Small natural and human-triggered wind slabs were seen on Saturday and again on Sunday at the Pass. With this recent activity, anticipate wind slabs on exposed slopes at mid and upper elevations. Given the wind direction (E-S), you may find some of these wind-loaded pockets in strange places and on different aspects. Pay close attention near convex rollovers, along the base of cliffs, in the tops of chutes, and on the sides of mid-slope gullies. 
Drifts, cornices, and textured surfaces could be your best clues to help highlight suspected wind-loaded slopes. In some spots, a few inches of soft fluffy powder could make spotting wind-affected snow a bit more difficult. Due to the strength of the recent winds, you may even find a small wind slab in the upper end of the below treeline band.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
The avalanche danger is slowly dropping after a rather stormy week. While you may encounter a passing shower, it shouldn’t have much bearing on the avalanche hazard. Since Saturday 2/25 around 4 feet of snow has fallen at mid and upper elevations near the Pass. An E-S wind event right at the tail end of the storm (3/4), redistributed the new snow and formed a fresh batch of wind slabs. We’ve seen a lot of these E-S wind events following storms this winter. They frequently result in more unintentionally triggered avalanches than normal because these slabs sit in places we aren’t often used to. 
The biggest question mark for Monday is the sky/sun and the possibility of loose wet avalanches. A new crust that formed on southerly aspects Sunday and a few more clouds should limit the potential for these wet slides. However, prolonged warm sunshine will result in the snow shedding from trees/rocks and triggering small loose wet slides. If you see new roller balls or tear-dropped piles of debris, expect natural avalanches from similar slopes. 
With unseasonably cold temperatures and so much new snow, travelers frequently reported deep conditions this week. Outside of wind-affected areas, the recent snow is right-side-up. Not surprisingly, avalanche activity has largely consisted of a few small natural and human-triggered wind slabs and loose dry avalanches. However, on Friday, one intentionally triggered small wind slab stepped down into older snow layers (2/25) and resulted in a large (D2) avalanche that ran 300 vertical feet. (2.5ft/80cm deep, N, 4300ft) While we think this is an isolated event, small facets and surface hoar have been observed on occasion at the 2/25 interface. An avalanche like this seems most probably in sheltered shaded terrain where those weak grains may have survived."

Even as the storm wraps up and skies start to break Sunday, dangerous avalanche conditions should remain. You could trigger slides in a variety of locations like wind-loaded slopes, sunny aspects, or rocky complex terrain. Give the snowpack time to heal by staying off open areas greater than 35 degrees.","Another strong E-S wind event built a fresh batch of slabs at the tail end of this storm. Some of these wind-loaded pockets triggered easily on Saturday. You could find wind slabs in some unusual locations and even hiding under an inch or two of softer snow. Keep your eyes peeled for clues of where these slabs might lurk. Drifts, cornices, and the snow blown out of the trees may give you the best hints as to where to look and what aspects to avoid. 
Common places to encounter winds slabs include below sharp cornices, along the base of cliffs, in the tops of chutes, and on the sides of mid-slope gullies. With the ferocity of the winds, you may even bump into a wind-loaded pocket in the upper end of the below treeline band. With the information we have from Saturday, assume wind slabs exist in most mid and upper elevation terrain until you can confidently rule them out.There’s plenty of loose snow out there. The question is the sun. Intense graupel snow showers could alternate with periods of sunshine.

Several days of stormy weather and recent avalanches all point toward dangerous avalanche conditions within the zone. You might think that the snow is light and fluffy everywhere, but you could still trigger a slab on steep convex slopes, especially if they are wind-loaded. If you see cracking of the snow surface or encounter stiffer pockets of snow, avoid slopes over 35 degrees.","If you’re going to trigger a slab avalanche on Saturday, it will likely be in wind-effected terrain. With plenty of low-density snow available for transport, new shallow slabs may be forming throughout the day or you could still encounter lingering slabs from earlier on in the storm. Increasing winds on Saturday should have an easterly component to them, meaning you could see some atypical loading patterns including slabs forming on different aspects or slopes being more cross-loaded than you are used to. Use visual clues such as blowing snow, textured surfaces, new cornices, or drifts behind objects to determine wind-loaded aspects. Once you know which way the wind was blowing, look for smooth “pillow-like” piles of snow that appear “fat” or feel stiffer compared to the surrounding snow to identify Wind Slabs. Using small test slopes or uptrack tests as you travel can give you clues about how wind-drifted snow is reacting to your weight as a traveler. As you ascend in elevation, you’ll likely need to manage Wind Slabs on more specific terrain features such as confined gullies and convex rollovers. As you reach the alpine, the distribution may expand to more open slopes over 35 degrees where the possibility of triggering an avalanche increases.In more wind-sheltered areas, plenty of low-density snow is available to produce avalanches in steep terrain. Some of these avalanches may technically fail as soft slabs but behave more loose since the recent storm snow is light and fluffy. If you find a pocket that has more cohesion, be aware that slab avalanches are still possible. Regardless of how you want to categorize them, they will be easier to trigger on steep slopes over 35 degrees and could grow in size as they move downhill and fan out. You should consider avoiding large open slopes at upper elevations until the snowpack has more time to settle.

Wind and precipitation should continue on Friday at Snoqualmie Pass, but intensities will likely be a notch lower than what was experienced on Thursday. As of Thursday afternoon, the Pass Proper has picked up somewhere between 5-8 inches of snow with wind gusts as high as 60 mph. 
Observations from Thursday are a bit limited, but Alpental Pro Patrol reported isolated Wind Slabs up to 1 foot deep during their morning mitigation efforts. On the eastern part of the zone, backcountry travelers near Cottonwood Lake reported similar depths as well as plenty of graupel mixed into the storm snow. They also reported seeing cornices fail naturally.
Prior to the storm widespread weak surface hoar was reported and a thin sun crust was expected to have formed on Wednesday afternoon on slopes that see direct sunshine. These prior surfaces could mean a poor bond has formed at the new/old interface and could result in some surprising avalanches breaking above you or spanning far distances. Combined with fluctuating freezing levels, strong winds, the reported graupel, and a less than steller bond even deeper in the snowpack at the 2/25 interface - there are numerous potential points of failure in the upper snowpack that you should investigate before committing to a slope. You should also be aware of freshly formed cornices, they will likely be sensitive and could fail easily."

If you’re going to trigger a larger avalanche it will probably be in wind-loaded terrain. Unfortunately shifting winds and a few inches of fluffy snow could make spotting these pillow-like slabs tricky. Steer around any steep slope where you suspect the wind formed slightly deeper slabs.","It may take a bit more investigation than normal to identify and avoid wind-loaded features. Some of the common clues we often use may not be visible or could be misleading. Assume wind slabs exist on all exposed features until you can prove otherwise. This includes wind-affected ridges, the base of cliffs, and rock walled chutes. 
Through the course of this storm, winds have switched from west, to east, to south, and back to west. Not surprisingly, this may have built wind slabs in lots of places, including areas you may not be used to. With the potential for odd loading patterns, use terrain to your advantage by seeking out lower consequence slopes.
Some of these slabs may be fresh and fail easily. Others could be older, harder to trigger, but deeper. If you feel firm or hollow snow, seek out less wind-affected or lower angled terrain. Outside of wind-affected areas, reports have been of very light fluffy snow that’s poorly bonded to the old surface. This could result in loose dry or very soft slab avalanches in steep terrain.

So, avoid all steep open areas where you find slightly firmer and thicker slabs of snow.","You may need to manage two versions of the same avalanche problem Monday. Increasing E-SE winds will start to form new slabs in some odd locations. During last week’s similar E-SE wind event, several backcountry travelers were surprised when they triggered wind slabs and a few even took unexpected rides. Fortunately, blowing snow and active drifting should make these new wind slabs easier to spot and avoid. Since they are fresh, you may find the trigger easily and run quickly on firmer snow below. 
It could be trickier to identify older slabs that formed during the storm Sunday. Some of these may even sit on slopes being stripped by the wind. Larger cornices, textured surfaces, and firmer deeper deposits of snow can help you anticipate these older slabs. While they might be harder to trigger, they cloud produce larger slides that may even break above you. Be particularly vigilant for these sneaky old slabs in rocky complex terrain near cliffs and chutes.We don’t often talk about sluffs as a problem, but in this particular case, we feel you may easily trigger loose dry or very soft slab avalanches that run quickly. Some of these slides could even travel far downslope over a firm bed surface. Don’t let one of these smaller softer slides catch you by surprise and take you for a ride higher consequence terrain.","AVALANCHE PROBLEM #2

This storm will likely create dangerous avalanche conditions at the Pass Sunday. As a result, you may trigger avalanches on a variety of steep slopes. So, choose simple, low consequence terrain that allows you easily identify and avoid open areas greater than 35 degrees. ","While this isn’t a huge storm, it should bring significant snowfall over a relatively short amount of time to the Pass. This will certainly result in an increase in the danger, but pinning down exactly what type of avalanche is a little harder. As a result, be leery of all open slopes greater than 35 degrees. 
Much of the danger will depend on how the new snow bonds to the old surface. Unfortunately, variable conditions were widely reported across the zone on Saturday. This could mean each slope responds differently. So, while hand pits, up track tests, and small slopes will give you an insight into this bonding, they may not represent the next opening in front of you. When conditions get tricky like this, low consequence, easy to manage terrain is a great answer. 
You may encounter storm slabs, wind slabs, and loose dry avalanches throughout your day. Expect the largest and most dangerous slides at mid and upper elevation, particularly where you see the wind blowing snow into deeper and firmer slabs.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
The stormy conditions Sunday will be pretty obvious, but don’t forget how that may impact the avalanche danger over short periods of time. You could find that avalanches trigger very easily (or fail naturally) during or immediately after intense snow showers and stronger winds. 
On Saturday a wide variety of snow surfaces were reported including wind textures, firm crust, soft powder, and weak grains (faces and surface hoar). Fortunately, these pockets of weak snow were localized which should help limit their ability to cause bigger avalanches. As we mentioned, this could cause the snow to act differently from one slope to the next. It also means you could see some avalanches run far and fast over those firm older surfaces. 
While we think most of the avalanche activity will occur at or above the new/old interface, we can’t rule out a few isolated slides breaking into older snow. It's been an active few days at the Pass with several natural and human-triggered avalanches. We wouldn’t be surprised for a few of these slides to either step down into older snow (2/19) or release a lingering wind-loaded pocket. 
On Saturday an NWAC forecaster traveled up the Alpental Valley to take a look at several of these recent avalanches. Crowns from natural wind slabs (Thursday) and human-triggered slides (Friday) were abundant on NW-N-NE facing terrain at mid and upper elevations. One of these slides caught and carried a tourer over a cliff down towards Snow Lake. He sustained significant injuries and was evacuated by King County Sheriff’s Medic One Helicopter. "

You could still trigger avalanches in wind drifted snow on Saturday. The most suspect slopes will be steep terrain below ridges, the base of cliffs, and confined chutes and gullies. So steer around these features and feel for stiff, hollow-sounding snow before committing to steep slopes.","Additional reports of backcountry travelers triggering avalanches came in on Friday. A skier triggered an avalanche above the Cache Couloir near Chair Peak and sustained significant injuries (see additional details in discussion). A separate party triggered a small wind slab at the top of the Cache Couloir. While wind slabs might be a bit more stubborn to trigger on Saturday, these avalanches are examples that it is still possible to find these lingering pockets where you could trigger a slide. Chutes, couloirs, and gullies are likely spots to trigger these wind slabs. Steep slopes below ridges and convex rolls are also potential trigger spots. Ease into the terrain using smaller, less consequential slopes to see how the snow reacts. If you feel firm hollow snow underneath you or see shooting cracks, step back and steer around these suspected wind-loaded areas.
It may be another clear day tomorrow, and with more moderate temperatures, you may see some wet loose avalanches and roller balls on steep, sunny slopes. Don't let a smaller avalanche knock you over and take you for a ride above a terrain trap. ","FORECAST DISCUSSION
A backcountry skier triggered an avalanche above the Cache Couloir. The individual was caught and carried over the cliffs and into the couloir, sustaining significant injuries. The King County Sheriff's Office and Seattle Mountain Rescue evacuated the injured skier by Helicopter.

An incoming storm on Saturday will bury the existing snow surfaces. With the recent cold temperatures, weak surfaces may have formed and be our next layer of concern. So take note of what surfaces you find out there on Saturday. 

A large natural storm slab occurred on Chair Peak on Thursday, and we suspect a cornice fall may have been the trigger. We do not think that this avalanche involved older snow layers. While we expect this avalanche to be the exception rather than the norm, we can't rule out larger storm slab avalanches with the amount of recent snow that has fallen. So slowly approach new terrain and assess conditions before committing to challenging terrain. 

All observations of recent avalanche activity involve just the recent snow above the rain crust/refreezing wet snow. We are still monitoring deeper interfaces in the snowpack, such as the 2/17 or 2/13 melt-freeze crusts. While we don't suspect these layers to be active, there is still an unlikely possibility of avalanches on these layers. This would most likely occur in isolated areas with a larger trigger, like a cornice or a smaller avalanche that steps down deeper in the snowpack."

Avalanches in wind drifted snow will continue to be easy to trigger on Friday. So avoid steep slopes with pillow-like drifts and confined alpine terrain features. We expect these slabs to be larger, more widespread, and easier to trigger as you ascend in elevation. ","Many reports of skier-triggered wind slabs came in on Thursday. You can anticipate little change in these sensitive wind slabs with cold temperatures and continued easterly winds. This easterly wind direction can surprise backcountry travelers used to focusing on slopes or aspects that are more commonly wind loaded by the typically westerly winds. Steep slopes below ridges and confined alpine terrain features such as chutes and gullies are likely places to trigger these wind slabs. 

It may be challenging to avoid these wind slabs at elevations above treeline, and you can also expect to find them on open slopes at lower elevations. Ease into the terrain using smaller, less consequential slopes to see how the snow reacts. If you find cracks or feel firm hollow snow underneath you, step back and stay off these suspected wind-loaded areas.

In wind-sheltered areas, it's still possible that you could trigger a storm slab avalanche on steep unsupported rollovers. As the sun comes out and temperatures moderate, you may still see some small dry loose avalanches running in very steep terrain. Don't let a smaller avalanche knock you over and take you for a ride above a terrain trap. ","FORECAST DISCUSSION

It was an active day on Thursday, with multiple reports of human-triggered avalanches. Most of these avalanches were on wind loaded test slopes and intentionally triggered. However, a skier was caught and carried a short distance by a small avalanche in a confined terrain feature, and they were on the surface and uninjured. Read more in the Observation. A large natural storm slab occurred on Chair Peak, and we suspect a cornice fall may have been the trigger. We do not think that this avalanche involved older snow layers. While we expect this avalanche to be the exception rather than the norm, we can't rule out larger storm slab avalanches with the amount of recent snow that has fallen. So slowly approach new terrain and assess conditions before committing to challenging terrain. 
The recent snow is generally right side-up with up to 2' of snow above the heavier, wetter snow received earlier in the storm cycle. With several inches of fluffy, low density snow to end the storm, several natural dry loose avalanches were observed in steeper terrain. Current observations of recent avalanche activity involve just the recent snow above the rain crust/refreezing wet snow. We are still monitoring deeper interfaces in the snowpack, such as the 2/17 or 2/13 melt-freeze crusts. While we don't suspect these layers to be active, there is still an unlikely possibility of avalanches on these layers. This would most likely occur in isolated areas with a larger trigger, like a cornice or a smaller avalanche that steps down deeper in the snowpack."

New wind slabs will form on atypical aspects and cross-load some slopes as East winds re-distribute recent dry snow.  Avoid steep open slopes below ridgelines where you see obvious signs of wind-loading.  At lower and mid-elevations, use caution on any steep slope where you find freshly drifted snow.  Bundle up - very cold temperatures and wind chills are forecast.  ","Winds have done a 180 from our storm cycle earlier this week.  East winds can surprise backcountry travelers used to certain slopes or aspects that are more commonly wind-loaded during a typical storm pattern.  Pay attention to which way the wind is blowing, literally, and avoid large open slopes below ridgelines where you see active wind-loading occurring.  Navigating safely above treeline will be difficult as some slopes become cross-loaded and fresh wind slabs develop.  
At lower and mid-elevations, you're likely to encounter blowing and freshly drifted snow as well.  Ease into the terrain by using smaller and less consequential slopes to see how the snow reacts. If you find cracks or feel firm hollow snow underneath you, step back and stay off of these suspected wind-loaded areas.
While the wind will be the primary concern on Thursday,  in wind-sheltered areas it's still possible that you could trigger a storm slab avalanche on steep unsupported rollovers or more likely, a small but fast-running dry loose avalanche in very steep terrain.  Don't let a smaller avalanche knock you over and take you for a ride above a terrain trap. ","FORECAST DISCUSSION
Avalanche Fatality: Colchuck Pk, East Central Zone: Read the preliminary report here.
Conditions were excellent on Wednesday with increasing new snow as you gained elevation at the Pass.  The new snow was generally reported as right side-up with up to 2' of snow above the heavier, wetter snow received earlier in the storm cycle.  With several inches of fluffy, low density snow to end the storm, several natural dry loose avalanches were observed in steeper terrain.  One small soft slab avalanche was observed in the Chair Peak area, likely triggered by cornice fall and another thin (2-3"") soft slab skier was triggered in the Cache Couloir. During periods of sunshine Wednesday, evidence of Monday's natural avalanche cycle was visible from the Source Lake area.  East winds were starting to move snow along ridgelines as winds increased into the moderate range.  
We expect most avalanche activity to remain in the new snow above the recent rain crust/refreezing wet snow. However, we can’t rule out an isolated avalanche breaking into deeper layers like the 2/17 or 2/13 interfaces. This would most likely occur in isolated areas with a larger trigger like a cornice or a smaller avalanche that steps down deeper in the snowpack.
However you recreate on Thursday, throw on some extra layers, and whatever else you need to stay comfortable and warm in case of an unplanned emergency.  It won't feel like March is around the corner over the next few days. "

If you’re going to trigger a significant avalanche Wednesday it will most likely be in steep wind-loaded terrain. Soft fluffy snow may hide some of the classic clues of wind-affected snow. Look for sharp cornices and drifts to indicate aspects you may want to avoid.","Sustained winds during the storm likely built firmer slabs on the lee sides of ridges, along the base of cliffs, and in the tops of rock-walled chutes. However, as winds decreased and snow continued to fall, these slabs may now be buried under a few inches of snow. That means they could be harder to identify and ultimately navigate. 
Look for larger clues like cornices and drifts to figure out local wind patterns and which slopes could be loaded. Assume wind slabs are hiding underneath the soft inviting powder in these areas until proven otherwise.
Ease into the terrain by using smaller and less consequential slopes to see how the snow reacts. If you find cracks or feel firm hollow snow underneath you, dial it back and stay off of these suspected wind-loaded areas.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
Avalanche Fatality: Colchuck Pk, East Central Zone: Read the preliminary report here.
We’re just coming out from a stormy few days at the Pass. Reports from Tuesday indicate lots of generally right-side-up soft snow over the new crust. However, due to the strong winds and near constant precipitation, observations have been very limited. That means we aren’t quite as confident about the current conditions, especially higher in the terrain. We suspect a natural avalanche cycle occurred Monday evening during the height of the storm. So far, only the 4 larger natural slides observed by an NWAC forecaster on Monday have been reported to confirm this. 
Storm totals will vary greatly as you gain elevation. At Pass level, weather stations reported 6-8in of new snow, while higher in the terrain, several feet of snow has fallen since 2/19. 
On Tuesday backcountry travelers triggered a few small loose dry avalanches in very steep terrain, even below treeline. This pattern should continue Wednesday. Don’t be surprised if you see a few natural loose slides from steep rocky slopes.  If the clouds thin or the sun pops out for a moment, it could exasperate this issue. 
We expect most avalanche activity to remain in the new snow above the recent rain crust. However, we can’t rule out an isolated avalanche breaking into deeper layers like the 2/17 or 2/13 interfaces. This would be most likely with a larger trigger such as a cornice or smaller avalanche."
