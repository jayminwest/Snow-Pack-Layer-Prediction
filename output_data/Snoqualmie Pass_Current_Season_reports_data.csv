A couple of inches of new snow in the afternoon could start to build small wind-loaded pockets higher in the terrain. Blowing snow and textured surfaces should help you easily identify where these spots might exist.","You may see a wind slab problem start to develop Sunday afternoon once a few inches of snow is available to blow around. Fortunately, these slabs should be rather small, shallow, and easy to anticipate. If your plans call for traveling near exposed ridgelines or close to some of the Pass’s summits, expect to find pillow-like slabs on the downwind side of features. Even though they should be pretty small, don’t let one of these tiny avalanches knock you over in steep terrain.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
First thing Sunday morning, you may find generally safe avalanche conditions around the Pass. Punchy wet snow, breakable crusts, icy slopes, and old piles of avalanche debris should be the norm. With southerly flow, this storm doesn’t really favor the Snoqualmie area. As a result, the modest precipitation during the day should help limit the hazard. 
Near and below the rain-snow line, you may find that the snow surfaces become a bit wet and sticky. We think at these lower elevations the snowpack will easily handle this little bit of rain. However, on very steep slopes, where you find wet mushy snow, you may be able to push a small loose avalanche. This will be most likely near rocky areas. Don’t let one of these very small slides carry you over a cliff. 
Even though we had a bit of spring weather this past week, below a thick layer of melt-forms the snowpack is still winter-like. As it continues its transition to spring, you may encounter isolated large “shed” style avalanches (glide, cornice, wet slab). On Sunday, these types of avalanches would be most likely at lower elevations. However, it's just good practice to not hang out in the runouts of large avalanche paths, especially if you see looming cornices or crevasse-like glide cracks on the slopes above. 
This is the last avalanche forecast for the 22/23 season. NWAC will continue issuing mountain weather forecasts each afternoon at 2:30 pm through April. We’d like to thank each of you for reading and using these forecasts to make informed safe decisions and for contributing to your community by submitting observations. Please continue to help support your backcountry friends by letting others know what you find in the mountains. Have a wonderful spring and summer! ~Dallas and Andy"

Cloudy weather and a cool breeze should help limit any wet snow concerns on Saturday and result in generally safe avalanche conditions. If you happen to find wet mushy snow on the surface, use a bit of caution. These conditions could result in isolated small loose wet slides.","In general, we expect the snow to be capped by a punchy crust or a solid icy surface. Without the help of the sun, this firmer snow will struggle to weaken. This should prevent most wet avalanches. However, if the snow surface doesn’t freeze or if there’s more sunshine than expected, you could find a few areas of wet unstable snow. You’re most likely to encounter one of these pockets near rocky outcrops and on more southerly aspects where the sunshine and warm temperatures can have the greatest effect. These small avalanches are often slow and easy to predict, but they can still push you over a cliff or carry you down a chute.","FORECAST DISCUSSION
Saturday will be a bit of a transition day for the mountains. An approaching storm will spread clouds and increasing winds across the zone, but there won’t be enough new precipitation to develop any real danger. As a result, we expect a generally stable snowpack with minimal avalanche concerns. However, you may encounter variable travel conditions with breakable crust, icy slopes, frozen debris, and pockets of dry snow. 
Besides the potential for loose wet slides, there are two other avalanche problems to consider. 
-If you travel near the tops of some of the higher peaks, you may find cold dry snow on shaded aspects. You could encounter isolated pockets of wind-loaded snow in these locations. Keep your eye out for firmer pillow-like drifts that might produce small slab avalanches. 
-Despite the date on the calendar, the snowpack at mid and upper elevations around the Pass has not fully transitioned to spring. In fact, below a stout upper crust (4/11) the snowpack is still very cold, dry, and layered. “Shed” style avalanche (glide, cornice, and wet slab) could still occur. While these seem very unlikely Saturday, it’s good practice to not linger in the runouts below large avalanche terrain. This is particularly true if you see looming cornices or crevasse-like glide cracks. "
